/**
 * Create a FizzBuzz class with a String toString(int) method, valid inputs > 0. 
 * Returns "Fizz" if number is a multiple of 3 or has 3 in it, 
 * returns "Buzz" if number is a multiple of 5 or has 5 in it,
 * and returns "FizzBuzz" if number is a multiple of 3 and 5 or has both 3 and 5 in it. 
 * 
 * Create a trivial test with input toString(1) should return 1, run the test, should fail. 
 * Now, write code to make this test pass
 * Create test for toString(3) should print Fizz, run test, note failure and write code to pass this test.
 * Create test for multiples of 3, should print Fizz, run test, note failure and write code to pass this test. Refactor code.
 * Create test for multiples of 5, should print Buzz, run test, note failure and write code to pass this test. Refactor code.
 * Create test for multiples of 3 and 5, should print FizzBuzz, run test, note failure and write code to pass this test. Refactor code.
 * Extend to print "Fizz" if number is divisible by 3 or if it has a 3 in it
 * Extend to print "Buzz" if number is divisible by 5 or if it has a 5 in it
 * Extend to print "FizzBuzz" if number is divisible by 3 and 5 or if it has both 3 and 5
